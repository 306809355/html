  Over time, modding has become a major cornerstone of gaming. From Stardew Valley to Skyrim, there are active and dedicated modding communities across almost every genre of game. While some games only feature small mods that
  fix bugs and upgrade graphics, other games are treated to hours of
  added content that can extend a game's longevity for decades after its release.
